## Basic Details

### Team Members
- Team Lead: Neha TK - Government Engineering College Kozhikode

### Project Description
This platform is a playful space where users can create and apply for completely fictional jobs, adding a touch of humor to the serious world of career building. It lets users explore imaginative, whimsical roles, fill out creative application forms, and even craft and download unique resumes for these dream-like positions. By combining humor with creativity, this project offers a way to de-stress, have fun, and celebrate the limitless potential of our imaginations.

### The Problem (that doesnâ€™t exist)
The world lacks a place where people can explore job titles from their wildest dreams! Ever imagined being a "Nap Consultant" or "Chief Plant Waterer"? Thereâ€™s never been a platform for expressing these ridiculous, fun ideas â€“ until now.

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
We've built a platform where users can submit, browse, and even "apply" for jobs theyâ€™ll never find on regular job boards. It brings humor and creativity to an otherwise serious space, inviting people to laugh, unwind, and dream up the most outlandish career paths.
